HOW TO ADD YOUR PHOTO
=====================

1. Put your photo in THIS folder (the same folder as index.html).

2. Name the file exactly:  profile.jpg

   - If your photo is PNG, rename it to profile.jpg
     OR save/export it again as JPG and name it profile.jpg

3. Refresh the portfolio page in your browser.

Your portfolio folder should look like:
  portfolio/
    index.html
    about.html
    ...
    profile.jpg   <-- your photo here
    HOW-TO-ADD-PHOTO.txt

That's it. The same photo will show on the home page (large) and in the top corner next to "Ritesh" on every page.
